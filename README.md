## MRI Data Analysis of Patients Diagnosed with Dementia
Written by Madhu Raghunath, Yamini Sasidhar, and Shishir Tewari

### Notes:
* Please refer to **team7_MRI.ppt** for our presentation.
* Our data cleanup and analysis is located in **final-notebook.ipynb**.
* The technical paper is marked **write-up.pdf**.
* The original dataset from Kaggle is named **calcs.csv**.
* We included each of our data exploration notebooks in a single folder marked **exploration/**. We did not combine our exploration into a single notebook file because we all used different methods and different variable names. All this work was done in joint with much discussion.
* All image output files are located in the folder marked **output/**.
