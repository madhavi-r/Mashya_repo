Our project aim is to identify trends in longitudinal MRI data of clinically non-demented and demented patients in the age group of 60-96. We hope to find indicators of patients at risk of being diagnosed with dementia, with focus on the time between subsequent visits.



 individuals at risk of dementia, with a focus on 
AD, incapacitating failure of memory
common symps: confusion, poor judgment, language disturbance, agitation, withdrawal, and hallucinations. 
- dementia, alzheimers prediction
- if data permits, early-onset

- Conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia


steps:
- clean and format data sets
- describe data exploration and cleanup process
- illustrate final data analysis
- matplotlib 6-8 visualizations of data
- save .pngs to distribute
- use API if applicable
- list 'questions'
- write-up to summarize major findings, heading for each question asked, short descriptions of what was found and relevant plots
